 * Libraries should go in this folder.

 * As we all know, the definition of library can be quite broad, especially among developers.
 * Everybody has their own particular way of doing things. There is no right or wrong.
 *
 * I like to think of 'libraries' as something that is used in multiple locations
 * throughout the application and have no direct dependency. Just use them as needed.
